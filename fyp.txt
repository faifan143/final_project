i want you to help me indexing my final year project paper ( a mini book summarizing my work )  like ( introduction , historical recap , basics ,  deepdive into the core the algorithms used and the comparisions and so on , then the GUI and the app designed to test and use these algorithms , then the feedback and the references )
the project description :
its a flutter app that is an adaptive platform provides a set of mindgames (sudoku , jigsaw puzzle , missing words , connect4 , chess , memory game , dots and boxes , math  quizes , competitive programming problems ) the purpose of the project is to forget the levels and difficulties for each game and focus on having fun playing or improving the skills (this idea of eliminating the levels acheived through an algorithm that calculate your performance and controls the difficulty of the games depending on your skills and performance so that it makes the ai agents of the games play against you in good level to you ) , this platform helps hyperactive kids to pour thier hype in this useful platform and helps the old to exercise their skills , memory and brain (like a mind gym) and ofcourse help the young to exploit their free time training their brain rather than surfing the social media
